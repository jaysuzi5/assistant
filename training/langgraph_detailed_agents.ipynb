The purpose of this agent is that it can do research on historical events and create a detailed report that will be saved as a markdown file.  This will be given a consistent prompt and the user should only have to supply an event.  The second agent/node is an evaluator.  This evaluator will review the report and ensure provide feedback.  Only after it is statified with the results will the process end.  This will also use two different LLMs with the history export using OpenAI and the reviewer using Gemini.  Each of these agents could also be set up with different tool sets as well, however, in this case, I will make the tools available to both."

    "2. After the summary, produce a detailed, lengthy, deeply researched historical report. Use section headers where appropriate. The report must include background, causes, chronology, major participants, significance, geopolitical impact, cultural or social consequences, and primary sources when available. Cite sources (Wikipedia or Google) in plain text, not with citation IDs or URLs unless required.\n",

    "       FILENAME: YYYYMMDDHHmm_<event_name>.md\n",

    "\n",
    "2. If ALL success criteria are met:\n",
    "   - Set success_criteria_met = true\n",

    "\n",
